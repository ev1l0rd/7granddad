## What is Pokémon Grand Dad version?
Pokémon Grand Dad refers to a Pokémon ROM hack made by the people behind the SiIvaGunner channel as part of their [Reboot arc ARG](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiIvaSunner/comments/4s8w0p/summary_of_the_reboot_for_those_who_are_confused/). It is a very small hack, featuring 'Chad' having a Pokémon battle against 'The Voice Inside Your Head', with the Pokémon being replaced by the memes commonly featured on the channel.

7 Grand Dad on it's own refers to a _The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy_ bootleg likely made by the J.Y. Company. Its primary features are a changed titlescreen and a modifcation of Fred Flintstones head to the sprite from _Super Mario Bros. 3_. It became popular after VineSauce's Joel livestreamed it (along with his reaction). It was eventually picked up by the SiIvaGunner channel who incorporated it in many of it's rips.
